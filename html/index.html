        <h3>This is some info about Dogs</h3>
        <p>The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. 
            Also called the domestic dog, it was domesticated from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene, over 14,000 years ago by hunter-gatherers, prior to the development of agriculture. 
            The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans.</p>
